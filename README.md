tipCalculator
=============

TipCalculatoriOS

A simple tip calculator that accepts the bill amount as an input.

By default the app will return the recommended tip amount for an individual for "Good" service.

The app allows modifying the number of guests and the tip percentage based on the quality of the service expected.

For visual purposes, the first time that the user loads the up we set the values to factory default with a red 
  background.

TO DO list:
- Vadalite numeric values
- Fix bug when slider is close to zero but the button to reduce the amount does not disappear until the slider 
  moves all the way in
- Add a utils.h file
- Better use of global variables
- Clear and release variables when terminating abruptly
